#SumOfNumbers

Write a function that accepts an integer argument and returns the sum of all the integers from 1 up to the number passed as an argument. 

For example, if 50 is passed as an argument, the function will return the sum of 1, 2, 3, 4, â€¦ 50. Use recursion to calculate the sum. 

Demonstrate the function in a program.
